'''

This document is the canonical manual for the **block-structured Linx Instruction Set Architecture (Linx ISA)**, version **v0.3**.

== Authority and Source of Truth

The single source of truth for instruction encodings in this repository is:

* `isa/v0.3/linxisa-v0.3.json` (machine-readable catalog built from `isa/v0.3/`)
* `isa/generated/codecs/` (generated encode/decode tables derived from the JSON)

Where this manual and the machine-readable catalog disagree, the JSON catalog MUST be treated as authoritative.

[IMPORTANT]
====
v0.3 unifies the previous v0.2 bring-up profile with v0.3 staged extensions. All architectural contracts are now defined in v0.3.

== Brand Mark

image::linxisa-logo.svg[align="center",width=140]

The LinxISA brand mark is a stylized **Lingxi** form that preserves the original silhouette while adding subtle semiconductor-style detailing (routed traces, pads/vias) to preserve crisp readability in manual PDFs, web docs, and toolchain-generated reports.

[[preamble-scope]]
== Scope and Maturity

This manual describes the **v0.3 Linx ISA** — a production-ready architecture that incorporates:

* The v0.2 bring-up baseline (privileged architecture, block-structured control flow, template blocks)
* v0.3 staged extensions (vector/tile operations, SIMD lane policy, MCALL modes)

The LinxISA project maintains alignment between:

* The machine-readable catalog (`isa/v0.3/linxisa-v0.3.json`)
* The LLVM backend (`compiler/llvm/llvm/lib/Target/Linx/`)
* The QEMU emulator (`emulator/qemu/target/linx/`)
* This manual

This manual focuses on:

* Architectural state and assembly conventions
* The block-structured control-flow model (`BSTART/BSTOP` and `BARG`)
* Template instructions (e.g. `FENTRY`, `FRET.*`) used by toolchains
* A complete instruction reference generated from the catalog
* Privileged architecture (ACR, SSR, trap envelope)
* Vector/tile extensions (v0.3 staged)
