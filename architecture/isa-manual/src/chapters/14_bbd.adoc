== BBD - Block Boundary Delimiters

The Block Boundary Delimiters (BBD) group defines the template block structure in Linx ISA. These instructions mark the beginning (BSTART) and end (BSTOP) of code blocks with execution hints.

=== BSTART - Block Start

The BSTART instruction marks the beginning of a template block and specifies the execution profile for the block.
